Information about my rails
CR-10 (v1) - 300x300 print size
You'll lose around 25mm on the Z-axis if mounted on specified alu profiles which sits on top of stock frame. 

Tips: 
  Always print out rail mounting alignment tools beforehand. If drilling holes in Y-sled, print drill template before and use drill press.
  Use 3.2mm drill bit for Y-sled
  Do not overtighten sled screws, use spring washers to secure screws. 
  Use M3 screws with T-nuts to secure rails
  Use M5 bolts with T-nuts to secure profiles
  
  Carriage drill dimensions: 
    MGN12H - 20x20mm
    MGN12C - 15x20mm
    
  Brands: 
    HIWIN - This is the top brand with the MGN sizes. Expensive and probably overkill.
    No-name: This is the usual "Chinese mainland" product. Can be hit or miss. Usual problems can be missing balls, bad balls, not lubed up from factory etc.
  
  If lucky, your carriage/rail had a small piece of plastic rail included. Use this to mount/remove carriages from rails!
  MGN12 uses 3/32" (2.381mm) bearing balls in case you need to replace or add more.
  If your carriage is a no-name brand I would recommend to clean the carriages in a bowl and then re-lube them. 
  Use PTFE lube and apply it with a suringe if your carriages have holes for lubing. Either way your carriages allows lubing it's the way to go.
  Lubing correctly flushes out dirt, allows lube to reach everywhere and makes the lube stay inside the carriage. 
  Don't put lube on the rails, it just creates a mess with no benefit.
