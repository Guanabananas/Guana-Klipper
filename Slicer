# These are my slicer codes. 
# I use SuperSlicer (Prusa clone) which you can get here https://github.com/supermerill/SuperSlicer! It's very adapted to Klipper! :)

# If using other slices change the variables to the following format (list incomplete):
# Cura: {material_print_temperature_layer_0} {material_bed_temperature_layer_0}

# Start Code. Variables within brackets so it changes with filament. M140 and M104 prevents some slicers from adding its own start code. 
M140 S0
M104 S0
M204 S500
START_PRINT BED_TEMP=[first_layer_bed_temperature] EXTRUDER_TEMP=[first_layer_temperature]

# Stop code. Keeps the bed hot after finished print. If you like me have a 12V bed you know it takes forever to get up to even 60C and I'm printing Nylon at 75C. Woho.
END_PRINT BED_TEMP=[first_layer_bed_temperature]

# After Layer Change. Timelapse frame trigger. Putting it on "After layer change" makes the printer retract before photo and then move to the new layer start.
# Instead of Timelapse-retract>Photo>Back to layer end>Retract>New layer.
